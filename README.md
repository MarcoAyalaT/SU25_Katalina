# **Water Cherenkov Detector Simulations**

This repository contains simulations designed to analyze the structural and thermomechanical performance of Water Cherenkov Detectors (WCDs). The goal of the project is to assess various WCD geometries and their performance under different environmental and structural conditions. These simulations are particularly aligned with the requirements of the Southern Wide-Field Gamma-ray Observatory (SWGO) project.

# **Project Overview**

Water Cherenkov Detectors are pivotal components in particle physics, primarily used for detecting Cherenkov radiation emitted by high-energy particles traveling through water. The mechanical and thermal properties of these detectors directly influence their reliability and longevity. This project addresses the structural and thermomechanical performance of WCDs to ensure they can withstand the harsh conditions of large-scale observatories like SWGO.

One significant addition to this project is the development of a smaller complementary tank designed to work alongside the primary larger tanks used in the detector array. This tank is intended to enhance detection efficiency and reliability by providing a more compact, specialized detection unit that works in tandem with the main WCDs.

The project's main objectives include:


# **Simulating Various WCD Geometries:**

The geometrical configurations of the primary and complementary tanks are tested to optimize the design for detecting Cherenkov radiation.
Evaluating Mechanical Behavior: Assessing how the detectors perform under different static and dynamic loads, such as environmental stressors, water pressure, and seismic activity.
Thermal Analysis: Analyzing the thermal stability of the detectors, ensuring that temperature fluctuations do not affect their functionality.

# **Structural Simulations:**

Using Finite Element Analysis (FEA), the mechanical stresses and deformations of the various WCD geometries, including both the main and complementary tanks, are thoroughly evaluated. This includes analyzing the structural integrity under different environmental factors like water pressure and temperature fluctuations.
Thermomechanical Simulations: The simulations are coupled to study the interaction between the thermal and structural behavior of the WCDs. By understanding how temperature changes affect the mechanical properties of the materials used, the project ensures the detectors can operate efficiently across a wide range of environmental conditions.
Comprehensive Design Evaluation: Both the large primary tanks and the smaller complementary tank are analyzed under realistic conditions that simulate the requirements and challenges of the SWGO project. This includes assessing the tanksâ€™ ability to handle stress, heat, and other physical factors while maintaining optimal performance.
Development of Complementary Tank: A smaller, supplementary tank has been designed as a complement to the larger primary tanks. This tank features a compact, yet efficient design intended to boost the overall detection capabilities of the WCD array. Its smaller size allows for a more flexible arrangement of the detectors and could potentially improve the overall sensitivity and stability of the detection system.
